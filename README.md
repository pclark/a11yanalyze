## üí° Best Practices

- Test early and often.
- Combine automated and manual testing.
- Use VPAT/Section 508 reports for compliance and procurement.
- Act on ‚ÄúDoes Not Support‚Äù and ‚ÄúPartially Supports‚Äù findings.
- **Encourage real user testing:** Always supplement automated/manual checks with feedback from people with disabilities.

---

## üîó Integration

- **CI/CD:** Add to your pipeline for automated checks.
- **Design System:** Use batch audits for all components.
- **Product Teams:** Use for web apps, static sites, and new features.

## WCAG & Section 508 Coverage

- **Automated Scanning:** This tool uses axe-core and custom rules to cover all testable criteria for:
  - **WCAG 2.1** (A, AA, AAA)
  - **WCAG 2.2** (including new 2.2 criteria)
  - **Section 508** (mapped to WCAG 2.0/2.1 AA)
- **VPAT Reporting:** Generates VPAT-style reports suitable for internal audits and procurement.
- **Manual Review Required:** Some criteria (e.g., color use, cognitive accessibility, content clarity) require human judgment and are flagged for manual review in the report.
- **Limitations:** Automated tools cannot fully assess all accessibility requirements. See the ‚ÄúKnown Limitations‚Äù section for details.

For a full mapping of automated vs. manual checks, see [docs/wcag-coverage.md](docs/wcag-coverage.md).

## How This Tool Compares to Other Accessibility Scanners

This tool is built on the industry-standard **axe-core** engine, just like the most popular accessibility tools (axe DevTools, Pa11y, Accessibility Insights, Storybook a11y, etc.), ensuring high accuracy and coverage.

| Feature/Tool         | This Tool       | axe DevTools | Pa11y | Lighthouse | Accessibility Insights | Storybook a11y |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **Screen Reader Simulation:**
  - The tool may report many elements with ambiguous or missing roles, especially on complex or highly dynamic sites. This is a known limitation of automated accessibility tree analysis and does not always indicate a real-world screen reader problem. Review these findings in context and supplement with manual testing.
- **Crawling Edge Cases:**
  - Some sites with heavy client-side routing, authentication, or non-standard navigation may not be fully crawled or analyzed. Adjust crawl depth, concurrency, and filtering options as needed.
  - Pages requiring login, CAPTCHA, or special headers may not be accessible to the scanner.
- **Experimental Features:**
  - Some advanced features (e.g., cognitive accessibility analysis, keyboard simulation, custom rule integration) are experimental and may not cover all edge cases.
- **Error Handling:**
  - The tool aims to provide clear error messages and logs, but some rare network or browser errors may require manual investigation.
- **VPAT/Section 508 Output:**
  - Automated VPAT reports are a starting point. Always supplement with manual review and expert judgment for procurement or compliance.

## Scanning Authenticated Pages

Some web pages require login before they can be scanned for accessibility. This tool supports scanning authenticated pages by automating the login flow using Playwright.

### How It Works
- Use the CLI options `--login-url`, `--username`, and `--password` to provide login credentials.
- The tool will:
  1. Launch a browser and navigate to the login page.
  2. Fill in the username and password fields.
  3. Submit the login form and wait for navigation.
  4. Use the authenticated session to scan the target page(s).

### Example Usage
```sh
a11yanalyze scan --login-url https://example.com/login --username myuser --password mypass https://example.com/dashboard
```

- For more complex login flows (e.g., SSO, MFA), see the documentation for cookie/session injection or custom Playwright scripts.

> This is the recommended approach for most teams. If you encounter issues with login, please consult the troubleshooting section or contact support.
