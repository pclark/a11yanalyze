# WCAG Accessibility Tester - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

The WCAG Accessibility Tester is a command-line utility designed for software developers, designers, and QA engineers to evaluate web pages and websites against WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards. The tool provides immediate, actionable feedback through detailed JSON reports and human-readable summaries, enabling teams to identify and fix accessibility issues early in the development workflow.

**Problem Statement:** Manual accessibility audits are time-consuming, expensive, and often occur too late in the development cycle. Teams need an automated, developer-friendly tool that provides immediate feedback on accessibility compliance while integrating seamlessly into existing workflows.

**Solution:** A local CLI tool that scans individual pages or crawls entire sites, generating comprehensive accessibility reports with clear remediation guidance and an overall accessibility score.

## Goals

### Business Goals
- Reduce time and cost associated with manual accessibility audits by 50% within six months
- Improve measurable site accessibility scores and compliance rates by at least 25% within the first quarter post-launch
- Position the product as an essential utility for development and QA teams at technology-driven organizations
- Decrease the number of critical accessibility issues found in production by 60%

### User Goals
- Provide immediate, actionable feedback on accessibility issues adhering to WCAG 2.2 AA standards
- Enable both targeted single-page audits and comprehensive website crawls
- Generate machine-readable JSON results for integration and further analysis
- Offer a clear, aggregate accessibility score for benchmarking progress across audits
- Seamlessly fit into existing development workflows without requiring significant setup

### Technical Goals
- Start with small to medium site support, with architecture designed for future scalability
- Focus on standalone functionality first, with CI/CD integration as a secondary priority
- Provide multiple installation options to accommodate different team preferences

## User Stories

### Developer
- As a developer, I want to test the web page I'm building for accessibility so that I can fix issues before code review
- As a developer, I want to run an audit with a single CLI command so that it fits seamlessly into my workflow
- As a developer, I want to export results in JSON format so I can integrate with my existing tools and CI pipelines
- As a developer, I want the tool to continue scanning even when it encounters errors so I get a complete picture of issues

### Designer
- As a designer, I want to understand which elements are causing accessibility failures so I can iterate on design decisions for better user outcomes
- As a designer, I want to see an overall accessibility score after a crawl so I can quickly assess the state of my designs across multiple pages
- As a designer, I want clear, jargon-free explanations of issues so I can understand how to fix them

### QA Engineer
- As a QA engineer, I want to crawl an entire staging site to identify accessibility issues before release so that we meet compliance requirements
- As a QA engineer, I want the tool to highlight both AA violations and AAA/ARIA warnings so I can prioritize remediation by severity
- As a QA engineer, I want detailed reports that I can share with development teams for remediation

## Functional Requirements

### Core Scanning Functionality
1. **Single Page Scan**: Execute accessibility tests on a single URL with full WCAG 2.2 AA coverage
2. **Site Crawling**: Crawl entire sites following in-domain links with configurable depth limits
3. **JavaScript Rendering**: Support modern web applications with JavaScript-enabled page rendering
4. **Error Resilience**: Continue scanning when encountering errors, reporting issues in final output
5. **Rule Engine**: Hybrid approach combining existing accessibility testing libraries (like axe-core) with custom WCAG 2.2 rules

### Output and Reporting
6. **JSON Primary Output**: Generate structured, machine-readable JSON reports as the primary output format
7. **Human-Readable Summary**: Provide optional console summary with key metrics and issue counts
8. **Detailed Issue Reporting**: Include WCAG/ARIA reference, element information, severity level, and suggested remediation for each issue
9. **Accessibility Scoring**: Calculate and output weighted, normalized accessibility scores for individual pages and aggregate sites
10. **Error Logging**: Report scanning errors, timeouts, and technical issues within the output structure

### Installation and Distribution
11. **Package Manager Support**: Distribute via standard package managers (pip for Python, npm for Node.js)
12. **Standalone Binary**: Provide self-contained binary downloads for major operating systems
13. **Docker Container**: Offer containerized version for consistent environments and CI/CD integration
14. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux environments

### Configuration System
15. **Progressive Configuration**: Start with minimal configuration options and sensible defaults
16. **Expandable Settings**: Design architecture to support increasing configuration complexity over time
17. **WCAG Level Selection**: Default to WCAG 2.2 AA with warnings for AAA and ARIA violations
18. **Crawl Configuration**: Configurable depth limits, domain restrictions, and page limits

### Performance and Scalability
19. **Small Site Focus**: Initially target small to medium sites (up to 100 pages)
20. **Scalability Architecture**: Design with future scalability in mind for larger site support
21. **Timeout Handling**: Implement reasonable timeouts for page loading and scanning operations
22. **Resource Management**: Efficient memory and CPU usage during crawling operations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Initial Release Exclusions
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: CLI-only interface for initial release
- **Cloud Services**: No web-based hosting, cloud storage, or remote processing
- **User Account Management**: No authentication, user profiles, or persistent user data

### Authentication and Advanced Features
- **Authenticated Content**: No support for login-required pages or gated content in initial release
- **Complex Site Interactions**: No form filling, multi-step user flows, or complex user interactions
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Focus on accessibility, not visual or functional testing
- **Performance Testing**: Accessibility-focused, not general performance metrics

### Integration Complexity
- **Deep CI/CD Integration**: Advanced CI/CD features postponed in favor of standalone functionality
- **IDE Plugins**: No editor or IDE integration in initial scope
- **Custom Reporting Formats**: Additional output formats beyond JSON and console summary

## Design Considerations
